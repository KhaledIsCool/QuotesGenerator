## Why use QuotesGenerator?
Because QuotesGenerator is an alternative to using an API and can easily be set up, it doesn't require anything, just an IDE or Terminal to run this in. Also, APIs that do this normally do have mistakes and flaws, such as downtime, duplication, errors, random strings combined in each other, and more. But QuotesGenerator doesn't require third-party servers and completely depends on you, the client.
